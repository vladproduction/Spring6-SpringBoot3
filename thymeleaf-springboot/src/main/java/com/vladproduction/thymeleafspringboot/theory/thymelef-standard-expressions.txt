Thymeleaf uses special expressions within your templates to control what gets displayed.
These are called Standard Expressions, and they come in a few flavors:

1. Variable Expressions: ${...}
These are the most common and use ${...} syntax.
They simply insert the value of a variable defined in your code into the template.
Example: Imagine a variable name set to "Alice". You can use ${name} in your template to display "Alice".

2. Selection Expressions: *{...}
These use *{...} syntax and let you navigate through objects in your code. They're like following a path to reach specific data.
Example: You might have a product object with a name property. * {product.name} would display the product's name.

3. Message Expressions: #{...}
These use #{...} syntax and are helpful for internationalization.
They allow you to display text based on the user's locale by referencing message keys defined elsewhere.
Example: You could have a message key "welcome.message" with the value "Welcome!".
#{welcome.message} would display the translated welcome message.

4. Link Expressions: @{...}
These use @{...} syntax and help you construct URLs for links in your template. They can dynamically build URLs based on variables or other data.
Example: You might have a link to a product detail page.
@{/products/{id}(id=${product.id})} would create a link to the product page using the product's ID.

5. Fragment Expressions: ~{...}
These use ~{...} syntax and are less common. They allow you to define reusable template fragments that you can include throughout your main template.

While these are the basic types, there's more to explore within Thymeleaf expressions, like operators and conditional statements.
